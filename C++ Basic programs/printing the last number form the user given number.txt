Problem statement:-

//Take a random number input from the user, and print the last number from the user given input as the output.//

#sol:- just assume suppose user entered following number
678, and you have to print the last number(that is 8).

Logic behind the problem:-  Divide the given number with 10, then you will get remainder 8.
and that 8 is the our final output. so use the '%' operator. it gives the 'Remainder value', but iof you can use the 
'/'(division operator) it gives the quocifiaent.

#Program in C++

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
int num, last_num;
cin>>num;
last_num=num % 10;
cout<<last_num;
return 0;
}
