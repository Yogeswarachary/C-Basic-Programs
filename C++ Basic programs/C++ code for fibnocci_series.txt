## C++ code for fibnocci series ##
//Program//

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

//Driving code
int main()
{
int n1 = 0,n2 = 1, n3, i, number; //'number' obj is used to asking the user to enter input. 
cout << "enter the number you want to see the fibonacci series";
cin << number;
cout << n1 << " " << n2 <<" "; //Printing the 0 and 1 values repectively.

for(int i=2; i<number ;i++) //we have n1=0 and n2=1, so that for loop starts from "2"
{
n3 = n1 + n2;
cout << n3;
n1 = n2;
n2 = n3;
}
return 0;
}

Eg output:- fabinocci series example
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.

//above n1=0 and n2=1 indicates that these are first elements in fibnocci series//
//n3 is output object for storing the n1 and n2 values.//
